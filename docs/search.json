    "text": "This project focuses on mapping crop types at the pixel level using multispectral satellite image time series. By leveraging both temporal and spatial information through a hybrid CNN architecture, we aim to accurately classify agricultural parcels across diverse French landscapes. The approach combines 1D convolutions for temporal encoding and a simplified U-Net for spatial segmentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor ground truth values, we utilize the 2023 Graphical Parcel Register (RPG) as the reference source. This dataset, provided as a shapefile, consists of polygons that precisely delineate agricultural parcels. Each polygon corresponds to an individual field and contains essential information: a unique identifier, its surface area measured in hectares (HA), and the identifier of the predominant crop grown on it during the 2023 cultivation season. The area covered is the entire contry with a total number of 9 797 405 parcels.\n\nonline visualisation\ndownloading link\n\n\n\n\nWe needed to clean the predominant crop identifier from the Registre Parcellaire Graphique (RPG) data. While the RPG encoding is useful for the Common Agricultural Policy (PAC), it isn’t ideal for our classification task.\nFor instance, the RPG distinguishes between “sweet maize” and “maize” with separate crop IDs. However, these two share a nearly identical spectral signature, making their separation irrelevant for our classification purposes. This initial RPG classification also results in an excessively large number of classes.\nBy using the classes defined by Turkoglu et al., we leverage an expert-crafted set of more meaningful and spectrally distinct crop categories. This approach effectively addresses the over-granularity of the RPG, merging spectrally similar crops (like sweet maize and maize) into single, relevant categories, and significantly reducing the total number of classes to a practical size for our classification.\nWe also reprojected the CRS of parcel geometries (Lambert 93 : EPSG:2154) to match Sentinel-2’s projection system (WGS84: reproject each tile to its native UTM zone ), guaranting accurate overlay.\n\n\n\n\nWe rely on Sentinel-2 Level-2A (Surface Reflectance)\nWe leverages 4 spectral bands from Sentinel-2 satellites to perform crop detection.

The SCL is a band within the Sentinel-2 Level-2A product that classifies each pixel based on its content (e.g., cloud, shadow, vegetation, water, snow). We use this layer to mask out all pixels not classified as vegetation, bare soil, or water (SCL classes 4 to 7), ensuring that clouds, cloud shadows, and other atmospheric artifacts are excluded from our analysis.\nFollowing the SCL masking, we compute a pixel-wise median for each month. Since each month provides between 6 and 15 images per band for a given area, the median composite is highly robust. We choose the median over the mean because it is significantly less impacted by outliers that might persist even after SCL masking (e.g., residual cloud edges or noise). This process also reduces the probability of having “absent pixels” due to clouds in our monthly composites.\nWhile median compositing greatly minimizes cloud-induced gaps, some might still occur. To address these, we implemented a pixel-wise temporal interpolation strategy:\n\nFor a missing pixel value in a given month: The new value is calculated as the mean of the corresponding pixel’s value from the previous month and the next month.\nFor missing values in the first month of the time series: We use the next available monthly value for that pixel.\nFor missing values in the last month of the time series: We use the last available previous monthly value for that pixel.\n\nAlthough this interpolation involves a nasty function with many for loops, it proves to be quite powerful in generating a complete and continuous time series of satellite imagery.\n\n\n\n\nDue to the extensive size of the covered area in France, we had to reduce the dataset used for modeling. To achieve this, we selected specific zones representing distinct agricultural landscapes, characterized by predominant crops and farming practices influenced by varying pedoclimatic conditions.\nThe following table lists these key agricultural zones across France, alongside nearby towns for geographic reference:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZone\nRegion\nNearby Town (Map Reference)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nNord-Picardie\nHauts-de-France\nSaint-Quentin (Aisne)\nSurrounded by large-scale crops (wheat, sugar beet, potatoes)\n\n\nParis Basin\nÎle-de-France / Centre\nChartres (Eure-et-Loir)\nHeart of the Beauce, vast cereal plains\n\n\nBrittany / Pays de la Loire\nBrittany / Vendée\nVitré (Ille-et-Vilaine)\nMixed zone: livestock, silage maize, hedgerows\n\n\nSouthwest\nNouvelle-Aquitaine\nAuch (Gers)\nCereal polyculture, maize, sunflower\n\n\nSoutheast\nProvence, Rhône-Alpes\nCarpentras (Vaucluse)\nVineyards, orchards, greenhouse vegetable farming\n\n\nMassif Central\nAuvergne\nRiom (Puy-de-Dôme)\nLimagne plain: polyculture on volcanic plains\n\n\nAlsace / Lorraine\nGrand Est\nColmar (Haut-Rhin)\nHillside vineyards + lowland crop farming\n\n\nMediterranean\nOccitanie, PACA\nBéziers (Hérault)\nVineyards, olive trees, vegetable crops, dry climate\n\n\n\nWe used ESA WorldCover (10 m resolution, global) to identify highly cultivated areas for sampling. From these representative landscapes, we selected five 10 km×10 km zones around each. This resulted in a total dataset covering 40 zones (8 regions × 5 zones each), each spanning 100 km^2.\nWe then extracted all parcels from the 2023 RPG that intersect with these zones, totaling 130,000 parcels with an average size of 1.5 HA.

    "text": "For ground truth values, we utilize the 2023 Graphical Parcel Register (RPG) as the reference source. This dataset, provided as a shapefile, consists of polygons that precisely delineate agricultural parcels. Each polygon corresponds to an individual field and contains essential information: a unique identifier, its surface area measured in hectares (HA), and the identifier of the predominant crop grown on it during the 2023 cultivation season. The area covered is the entire contry with a total number of 9 797 405 parcels.\n\nonline visualisation\ndownloading link\n\n\n\n\nWe needed to clean the predominant crop identifier from the Registre Parcellaire Graphique (RPG) data. While the RPG encoding is useful for the Common Agricultural Policy (PAC), it isn’t ideal for our classification task.\nFor instance, the RPG distinguishes between “sweet maize” and “maize” with separate crop IDs. However, these two share a nearly identical spectral signature, making their separation irrelevant for our classification purposes. This initial RPG classification also results in an excessively large number of classes.\nBy using the classes defined by Turkoglu et al., we leverage an expert-crafted set of more meaningful and spectrally distinct crop categories. This approach effectively addresses the over-granularity of the RPG, merging spectrally similar crops (like sweet maize and maize) into single, relevant categories, and significantly reducing the total number of classes to a practical size for our classification.\nWe also reprojected the CRS of parcel geometries (Lambert 93 : EPSG:2154) to match Sentinel-2’s projection system (WGS84: reproject each tile to its native UTM zone ), guaranting accurate overlay.\n\n\n\n\nWe rely on Sentinel-2 Level-2A (Surface Reflectance)\nWe leverages 4 spectral bands from Sentinel-2 satellites to perform crop detection. These bands allow us to extract detailed information about vegetation based on light reflectance at specific wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBand\nName\nResolution\nWavelength (S2A / S2B)\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nB2\nBlue\n10 m\n496.6 / 492.1 nm\nChlorophyll detection, cloud cover analysis\n\n\nB3\nGreen\n10 m\n560 / 559 nm\nVegetation contrast, plant health analysis\n\n\nB4\nRed\n10 m\n664.5 / 665 nm\nNDVI calculation, vegetation growth tracking\n\n\nB8\nNIR\n10 m\n835.1 / 833 nm\nBiomass detection, distinguishes soil vs vegetation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo effectively manage clouds in our satellite imagery, we leverage the Scene Classification Layer (SCL) provided by Sentinel-2. The SCL is a band within the Sentinel-2 Level-2A product that classifies each pixel based on its content (e.g., cloud, shadow, vegetation, water, snow). We use this layer to mask out all pixels not classified as vegetation, bare soil, or water (SCL classes 4 to 7), ensuring that clouds, cloud shadows, and other atmospheric artifacts are excluded from our analysis.\nFollowing the SCL masking, we compute a pixel-wise median for each month. Since each month provides between 6 and 15 images per band for a given area, the median composite is highly robust. We choose the median over the mean because it is significantly less impacted by outliers that might persist even after SCL masking (e.g., residual cloud edges or noise). This process also reduces the probability of having “absent pixels” due to clouds in our monthly composites.\nWhile median compositing greatly minimizes cloud-induced gaps, some might still occur. To address these, we implemented a pixel-wise temporal interpolation strategy:\n\nFor a missing pixel value in a given month: The new value is calculated as the mean of the corresponding pixel’s value from the previous month and the next month.\nFor missing values in the first month of the time series: We use the next available monthly value for that pixel.\nFor missing values in the last month of the time series: We use the last available previous monthly value for that pixel.\n\nAlthough this interpolation involves a nasty function with many for loops, it proves to be quite powerful in generating a complete and continuous time series of satellite imagery.\n\n\n\n\nDue to the extensive size of the covered area in France, we had to reduce the dataset used for modeling. To achieve this, we selected specific zones representing distinct agricultural landscapes, characterized by predominant crops and farming practices influenced by varying pedoclimatic conditions.\nThe following table lists these key agricultural zones across France, alongside nearby towns for geographic reference:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZone\nRegion\nNearby Town (Map Reference)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nNord-Picardie\nHauts-de-France\nSaint-Quentin (Aisne)\nSurrounded by large-scale crops (wheat, sugar beet, potatoes)\n\n\nParis Basin\nÎle-de-France / Centre\nChartres (Eure-et-Loir)\nHeart of the Beauce, vast cereal plains\n\n\nBrittany / Pays de la Loire\nBrittany / Vendée\nVitré (Ille-et-Vilaine)\nMixed zone: livestock, silage maize, hedgerows\n\n\nSouthwest\nNouvelle-Aquitaine\nAuch (Gers)\nCereal polyculture, maize, sunflower\n\n\nSoutheast\nProvence, Rhône-Alpes\nCarpentras (Vaucluse)\nVineyards, orchards, greenhouse vegetable farming\n\n\nMassif Central\nAuvergne\nRiom (Puy-de-Dôme)\nLimagne plain: polyculture on volcanic plains\n\n\nAlsace / Lorraine\nGrand Est\nColmar (Haut-Rhin)\nHillside vineyards + lowland crop farming\n\n\nMediterranean\nOccitanie, PACA\nBéziers (Hérault)\nVineyards, olive trees, vegetable crops, dry climate\n\n\n\nWe used ESA WorldCover (10 m resolution, global) to identify highly cultivated areas for sampling. From these representative landscapes, we selected five 10 km×10 km zones around each. This resulted in a total dataset covering 40 zones (8 regions × 5 zones each), each spanning 100 km^2.\nWe then extracted all parcels from the 2023 RPG that intersect with these zones, totaling 130,000 parcels with an average size of 1.5 HA. And retrieve computed median satellites images of teh studied zones for each month via the google earth engine API.\nDespite this effort to ensure geographical diversity, we still face a highly imbalanced class distribution across crop types — some crops are vastly overrepresented while others have very few examples.\nThe figure below illustrates this imbalance (note the logarithmic scale on the y-axis).\nThis skew can significantly affect evaluation metrics: in particular, accuracy may be misleading, as the model can achieve high accuracy by favoring dominant classes. Therefore, we also report macro-averaged metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) that treat all classes equally, regardless of frequency.\n\n\n\nFor each of the eight agricultural regions described above, we selected one 10×10 km zone out of the five available to serve as the test dataset. So 20% of the dataset is held out for testing, and that each region is represented in the test set.\nThis allows us to evaluate the model’s ability to generalize to completely unseen geographic areas across diverse agro-climatic contexts.\nThe remaining 32 zones were used for training and validation. To optimize model performance while managing computational cost, we adopted a 3-fold cross-validation (CV) approach on the training set. A higher number of folds (e.g., K &gt; 3) was avoided due to the long training times associated with deep learning models on large spatial-temporal datasets.\nThis spatially-aware split avoide any data leakage between training and test areas."
