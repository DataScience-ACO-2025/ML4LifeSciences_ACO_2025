## description Projet

This project explains the architecture of a ResNet and compares it to a traditional CNN in the context of classifying microscopic images of pathogenic fungi. We explain how skip connections enable ResNet models to preserve information and ease gradient flow, addressing limitations of deeper conventional CNNs. Both architectures were tested on the fungal image dataset to evaluate differences in learning efficiency and classification performance.
